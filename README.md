# PDF Decryptor

This repository contains the frontend of the [PDF Decryptor](https://pdfdecryptor.vercel.app/) website.

## What is this website?

Use it if you want to create a passwordless copy of a PDF file. It takes only three steps:

1. Choose your file
2. Type the PDF password
3. Press Decrypt

The website won't brute-force the password. You need to know the correct one to open it. I don't endorse the "hacking" of random PDF files, so you cannot use the website for this purpose.
